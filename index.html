<p>My name is Tony Gagliardi and this is a place where I put random things. I graduated from the University of Colorado at Boulder at the end of 2015 with a degree in Computer Science focusing in network engineering. I was fortunate to spend one of those semesters in Europe while studying abroad at the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona.
        <br>
        <br> In the past I've worked as an eSports tournament director, professional services consultant, network engineer, and IT business analyst. I currently live in Denver, Colorado where I work in the information security field and coach baseball.
        <br> 
        <br> I love baseball because I think it is a great teaching tool. Just like in life, failure is guarenteed.
        <br>
        <br> Studying abroad sparked a love of travel. I am fascinated by world history and other cultures. 
        <br>
        <br> I occasionally write about things that interest me. Hope you enjoy!
