<p>I am currently a Systems Administrator at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, but I will be joining Phillips 66 on May 20th as a network security intern. I recently became involved with the Linux Foundation's realization of Software Defined Networking where I am working on the Defense4All project and am a member of the Security Analysis team. </p>
